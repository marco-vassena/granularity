import Lattice as L

module FG2CG.Graph (ùë≥ : L.Lattice) where

-- The following modules define several inductive relations that
-- capture the translation for most of the categories of the calculus.
-- These relations are suitable to prove properties and lemmas that
-- require back-translating terms, e.g., unlifting and injectivity.
